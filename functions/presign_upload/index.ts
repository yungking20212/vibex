// Deprecated: presign_upload Edge Function
// This file has been deprecated and replaced by client-side uploads in the app.
// The project now uses direct storage uploads via the Supabase Swift SDK.
// If you still require server-side admin operations, implement a new function
// that reads a SERVICE_ROLE secret from the environment and performs only the
// necessary admin tasks. Do NOT commit service role keys to source control.
