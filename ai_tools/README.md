Vibex AI tools registry and training pipeline overview

This folder contains a minimal agent registry for the iOS app and pointers to the ML training pipeline located under `ml/`.

- `agent_registry.swift`: lightweight registry and placeholder tool implementations for the app to reference.
- `placeholder_tool.swift`: example tool to wire into the UI.

See `ml/README.md` for training instructions and a small sample dataset.
